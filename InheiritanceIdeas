What if we used the DOM more effectively? Perhaps we could have an "on" path/group that we add and subtract pieces from. 

Also, we have to solve the trouble of those diodes. Directional current...(doesn't allow reverse ones)

The standby battery can power the essential bus. 

Don't forget to fix the switch "bar" color on the standby switch...

It would be easy with one power source. It's either on or off. But with multiple sources, how to determine the flow?

What if we used the DOM more effectively? Perhaps we could have an "on" path/group that we add and subtract pieces from. 

Also, we have to solve the trouble of those diodes. Directional current...(doesn't allow reverse ones)

The standby battery can power the essential bus. 

Don't forget to fix the switch "bar" color on the standby switch... [What do you mean?]

It would be easy with one power source. It's either on or off. But with multiple sources, how to determine the flow?


Well the power sources currently function under the idea that only one power source has  priority at any given time, with the priortieis being alternator > external > battery > standby battery. You could conceivably just move
the element from group to group to achieve this, but unless there is an issue with performance right now I don't see the need to do this specific optimization unless performance is suffering. ~Gavin

Furthermore, as per the comment about the diodes: I don't see them acting in a way that wasn't intended -- power from the ESS bus currently does not flow "back" in a way that is unexpected. This is easily testable by arming
the standby battery and seeing that only the ess buss gets powered. If the diodes allowed backflow then electric bus 1 and 2 would also power up. Either way, all 'edges' in the schematic simulation code are unidirectional,
so it wouldnt require any changes to the logic to get the intended functionality. ~Gavin
